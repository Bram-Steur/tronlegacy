    <h1>Story</h1>

    <p>
      In 1989, Kevin Flynn, who was promoted to CEO of ENCOM International seven years earlier,[N 1] disappears. Twenty years later, his son Sam, now ENCOM's primary shareholder, 
      pranks the corporation by releasing the company's signature operating system online for free. ENCOM executive Alan Bradley, Kevin's old friend, approves of this, 
      believing it aligns with Flynn's ideals of free software. Nonetheless, Sam is arrested for trespassing.

      Alan posts bail for Sam and tells him of a pager message originating from Flynn's shuttered video arcade, after being disconnected for 20 years. 
      There, Sam discovers a hidden basement with a large computer and laser, which suddenly digitizes and downloads him into the Grid, a virtual reality created by Kevin.
       He is captured and sent to "the Games", where he must fight a masked computer program named Rinzler. When Sam is injured and bleeds, Rinzler realizes Sam is human, 
       or a "User". He takes Sam to Clu, the Grid's corrupt ruling program, who resembles a young Kevin.

      Clu nearly kills Sam in a Light Cycle match, but Sam is rescued by Quorra, an "apprentice" of Flynn, who shows him Kevin's hideout outside Clu's territory. 
      Kevin explains that he had been working to create a "perfect" computer system and had appointed Clu and security program Tron as its co-creators. 
      The trio discovered a species of naturally occurring "isomorphic algorithms" (ISOs), with the potential to resolve various natural mysteries. 
      Clu, considering them an aberration, betrayed Kevin, killed Tron, and destroyed the ISOs. The "Portal" permitting travel between the two worlds closed, 
      leaving Kevin trapped in the system. Clu sent the message to Alan hoping to lure him into the Grid (though Sam serves his purpose just as well) and reopen the Portal for a limited time. 
      Since Flynn's "identity disc" is the master key to the Grid and the only way to traverse the Portal, Clu expects Sam to bring Kevin to the Portal so he can take Flynn's disc, 
      go through the Portal himself, and impose his idea of perfection on the human world.

        Against his father's wishes, Sam returns to Clu's territory and encounters one of the Sirens, Gem to help find Zuse, a program who can provide safe passage to the Portal. 
        At the End of Line Club, the owner reveals himself to be Zuse, then betrays Sam to Clu's guards. In the resulting fight, Kevin rescues his son, 
        but Quorra is injured and Zuse gains possession of Flynn's disc. Zuse attempts to bargain with Clu over the disc, but Clu instead destroys the club along with Zuse and Gem. 
        Kevin and Sam stow away aboard a "Solar Sailer" transport program, where Flynn restores Quorra and reveals her to be the last surviving ISO.

        The transport is intercepted by Clu's warship. As a diversion, Quorra allows herself to be captured by Rinzler, whom Kevin recognizes as Tron, 
        not killed by Clu but rather reprogrammed. Sam reclaims Flynn's disc and rescues Quorra, while Kevin takes control of a Light Fighter. Clu, Rinzler, 
        and several guards pursue the trio in Light Jets. Rinzler remembers his past as Tron and deliberately collides with Clu's Light Jet, then falls into the Sea of Simulation below. 
        Clu confronts the others at the Portal, but Kevin reintegrates with his digital duplicate, 
        destroying Clu along with himself. Quorra – having switched discs with Kevin – gives Flynn's disc to Sam, 
        and they escape together to the real world as the ensuing explosion from Kevin's sacrifice levels the Sea of Simulation.

        In Flynn's arcade, Sam backs up and deactivates the system. He then tells a waiting Alan that he plans to retake control of ENCOM, naming Alan chairman of the board. 
        Sam departs on his motorcycle with Quorra as the sun rises.
